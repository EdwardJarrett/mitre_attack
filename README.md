## Teaching
A listing of JSON files which can be used with the ATT&CK Navigator (July 2020 Release - v7.0) to view the five different categories of techniques within the framework. 

- **Blue** These are techniques which are not really exploitable, rather they use other techniques to be viable.
- **Green** These are the easiest techniques to exploit, there is no need for POC malware, scripts, or other tools.
- **Yellow** These techniques usually need some sort of tool, such as Metasploit. 
- **Orange** These techniques require some level of infrastructure to setup. Once setup, some are easy and some are more advanced. 
- **Red** These are the most advanced techniques which require an in-depth understanding of the OS or custom DLL/EXE files for exploitation.
-**Purple**These are high level techniques which include sub-techniques of varying levels.
